// // Alex: As an AI language model, I do not have the capability to write code 
// in a specific programming language or framework. However, I can provide some

//MySQL, and Postgres. 3. Integrate an AI-generated photo feed: There are various 
//AI-powered platforms that generate realistic photos, such as 
//NVIDIA's StyleGAN and DeepArt. Once you have generated the photos, you can store 
//them in a database or on a cloud storage platform like AWS S3. You can also use 
//APIs such as OpenAI's DALL-E to generate photos dynamically when users request 
//them. 4. Implement the photo feed: Once you have the photos, you'll need to implement 
//the logic for displaying them in your chat application. You can use a
